excerpt: "Why does a human want more? What drives us to desire aimlessly? If the universe acts through us anyway, what is our role in this grand design?"
---

Getting high is something that is weird, You know why does a human wants to get high on substances. What is the need of any human being to desire. Why do we desire more than what we would be satisfied with? Be it food, clothes or any basic necessities why does a human being want more. Why more? Why does a human want all of it? What drives humans to want aimlessly and desire aimlessly. We can become whatever we want to, I believe every human being has the capabilities to do very great things, but we aimlessly scatter our wants? we want more of something and if we don't channel that more and not focus in on greater higher aspirations, we would be dwelling on becoming; with or without our want into something that could be monumentally dangerous. Destruction. If destruction is something through which change transmutes, what is good and bad destruction? We have no measure of knowing. It seems as if we would never be able to tell which creation and which destruction will lead to a better future. It is something we cannot just project.

Then how do you know at all. If a human's doings can reflect into reality as something which can collaborate with the rest of the human doings to be destructive and constructive, we are then too small. Whatever we think we can do. Even with a deep desire and the want to change the world a man walks, he has no idea what he will dawning upon the face of earth, only nature knows. But nature is still very abstract and we cannot conceive of it's plans, it's not just about abstraction, it seems to be brilliantly so intelligent we cannot just grasp on it's plan. If we could, if a human could reach to the realisation and frequency of universe and he becomes it, would he still put in so much effort to aspirationally change the world. If he does or doesn't, it does not matter does it, it's still universe acting though him and he is still gonna be contained inside of the universe but just with maybe more realisation still he would be in the universe as we all are.

I am not enlightened, and if I was would I be writing this or would choose to not write it because I am not searching for answers, when I would have answers why would I want to act in this world with the drive and impetus to change. Why am I obsessed with change, whether I change the world or not, it will still play out as per universe designs, The magnitude of my hypothetical action to change the world would just be done by a bunch of people which may at the end still lead to the same outcome. Universe is then how it is, with or without me. When I try to change the world, the universe just acts through me and will push me in the directions it wants me to take to achieve it's goals, and I would be under the illusion that the actions are mine with or without the involvement of anything else. But universe is still always involved. If I ever reach to the stage of self realisation where it dawns on me what the universe wants and I still want to change the world. The universe will still achieve it projected design, I would just be aware of it and aligned with it in a amplified manner.

But isn't that still pointless maybe that is what the realisation we need to absorb, We are minute, minuscule ridiculed by ego to think we matter, maybe we do not at all. Wether we choose or not choose to act in this world, universe by balance will systematically or chaotically still achieve it's wondrous design, or it already as achieved it and it's just manifesting it into physicality which we think matters more, but all that will happen has already occurred in the casual plane, the designs are complete. There is nothing to be brought into existence only the truth conceived and manifested physically is what we achieve. But then the beauty is, if we choose to be a larger part of the conception and physical creation we in our experience can do real stuff of grander magnitude, so alignment will let you experience what you want but the outcomes are already decided, wether you will do it or an other person will is so arbitrary that it is not in our bounds to think about. It's a choice if you want to align to a part of it and experience the best possible play of the predestined outcomes into the universe.
